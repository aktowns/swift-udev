/*
 libudev example.

 This example prints out properties of each of the hidraw devices. It then creates a monitor
 which will report when hidraw devices are connected or removed from the system.

 This code is meant to be a teaching resource. It can be used for anyone for any reason,
 including embedding into a commercial product.

  This section sets up a monitor which will report events when devices attached to the system
  change.  Events include "add", "remove", "change", "online", and "offline".

  This section sets up and starts the monitoring. Events are polled for (and delivered) later
  in the file.

  It is important that the monitor be set up before the call to udev_enumerate_scan_devices()
  so that events (and devices) are not missed.  For example, if enumeration happened first,
  there would be no event generated for a device which was attached after enumeration but
  before monitoring began.

  Note that a filter is added so that we only get events for "hidraw" devices.
